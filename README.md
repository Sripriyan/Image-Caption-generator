# Image Caption Generator

## Overview
This project focuses on building an image captioning system using Python. The system processes images and generates descriptive captions, leveraging various libraries and tools to achieve this functionality.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- The necessary Python libraries, which you can install as outlined below

## Installation
To get everything set up, you'll need to install a few libraries. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install pycocotools
```

## How to Use This Notebook
1. **Library Setup**:
    - Ensure you have all the required libraries installed using the command above.

2. **Running the Notebook**:
    - Open `Image_Captioning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
    - Execute the cells one by one to see the code in action and understand how it works.

## What's Inside
Here's a quick rundown of what you'll find in the notebook:
1. **Library Installation and Imports**:
    - Commands to install the required libraries.
    - Import statements for all the libraries used in the notebook.

2. **Image Processing**:
    - Code to handle image input, including downloading and extracting image datasets.

3. **Caption Generation**:
    - Steps to process the images and generate descriptive captions using pre-trained models and custom algorithms.

## Code Highlights
Here are some snippets of the key parts of the notebook:

### Installing Libraries
```python
import os 
import sys
from pycocotools.coco import COCO
import urllib
import zipfile
```

### Setting Up Paths
```python
path=os.getcwd()
path
```

### Example of Image Processing and Caption Generation
```python
# Example code for downloading and processing images
def download_images(url, path):
    # Code to download and extract images
    pass

# Example code for generating captions
def generate_captions(image_path):
    # Code to generate captions for the image
    pass
```
